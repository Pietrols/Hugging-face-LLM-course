So, he decided to talk to his mom about it.\\n\\nHis mom listened carefully and then said, \"Timmy, I think Roxy might be having some trouble dealing with her stress.\" Mom explained that Roxy is a pet rabbit, and just like humans, they can feel stressed out too. Sometimes, things happen that make them uncomfortable or upset. They need to find ways to cope and keep themselves calm and happy.\"\\n\\nTimmy wondered, \"What does \\'cope\\' mean?\" Mom smiled and replied, \"Coping means finding ways to deal with difficult things, like Roxy\\'s stress. It can be through talking to someone, doing something fun, or going outside to play!\"\\n\\nNext, Mom gave Timmy some tools to help him cope with Roxy\\'s stress.
